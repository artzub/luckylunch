# IntraStateSpending
Executive Dashboard of Indiana Procurement Card spending - 2015

The State of Indiana is openning access to its spending history data. With this new visibility and transparency we can gain insight 
into the buying behavior of its employees and agencies. We now have a new tool to help with governence and accountability.
This project uses D3js, Canvas, blackHole, MongoDB and leverages existing visualation projects; clearspending, luckylunch and Hygieia.
